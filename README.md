Overview

This repository serves as a portfolio of machine learning projects, covering topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and data preprocessing. The projects are implemented primarily in Python, using popular libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and pandas.


Projects

Classification Project: A predictive model for classifying data using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

Regression Project: A project focusing on predicting continuous outcomes using Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.

Computer Vision Project: Image classification and object detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras.

Natural Language Processing Project: Sentiment analysis or text classification using NLP techniques with libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

Clustering Project: Unsupervised learning to group data points using K-Means and DBSCAN.

Each project folder contains its own README with detailed instructions, datasets, and results.



Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-projects.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd machine-learning-projects


Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.


Usage

Each project is self-contained. To run a specific project:

Navigate to the project folder (e.g., cd classification-project).

Follow the instructions in the project's README.

Run the main script, typically:

python main.py

Datasets are included in each project folder or can be downloaded as specified in the project README.
